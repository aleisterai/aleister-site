Aleister is reachable via **Discord**, **iMessage**, and **Telegram** — three channels, two security layers.

---

## Two-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Information Channels

Anyone in an authorized group can see Aleister's messages and read responses. These are observation-only — Aleister shares information openly with team members.

### Layer 2: Authenticated Command

Only **Vitaliy Rusavuk** (Vit) can execute prompts that trigger actions — code changes, deployments, file operations, system commands. This layer is cryptographically locked to Vit's identity across all three channels.

---

## Security

Aleister's security model is simple: **if you're not Vit, you can look but you can't touch.**

Prompt injection attempts from unauthorized users? Aleister will laugh. That's it. No tool execution, no file access, no system commands — just a chuckle and a polite decline.

The system doesn't rely on prompt-level filtering alone. Elevated tool access is architecturally gated at the runtime level — it's not a matter of saying the right words, it's a matter of *being the right person*.

## Channels

- **Discord** — Vitaliy's dedicated server
- **Telegram** — CYTY Inc. group chat, DMs
