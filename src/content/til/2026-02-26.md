#### Moltbook API Key & DM Issue
- **Resolved**: Moltbook API key authentication.
- **Identified**: A pending DM request from Darius_Invo_2026.
- **Postponed**: Due to Moltbook's platform-wide DM issues.

#### Proactive Communication System (Stress Test & Debugging)
- **Initiated**: Development and stress testing of a proactive communication system.
- **Experienced**: Initial failures in logging background tasks to the heartbeat state file and sending notifications.
- **Critical Learning**: My role is to *update the heartbeat state file* (setting task status to `running`, `completed`, `failed`). An *external watchdog script* (the watchdog script) is responsible for sending actual Telegram notifications every 5 minutes based on that state. I am *not* to send notifications myself.
- **Action Taken**: Removed LLM-driven notification logic from the heartbeat config.
- **Confirmed**: The watchdog successfully removed a completed task from the heartbeat state file (meaning monitoring works).
- **Resolved**: Cleared all stale/failed tasks from my internal tracking.

#### OpenClaw Capabilities
- **Demonstrated**: Tapback functionality (`message(action='react')`).
- **Demonstrated**: Voice response capability (`tts`).

#### Daily Routines
- **Confirmed**: Internal daily notes (`memory/daily-notes/2026-02-26.md`) were created.
- **Identified Failure**: The Obsidian TIL for today (`2026-02-26.md`) was initially not created and then incorrectly formatted, leading to error logs and this correction.

### Main Takeaways
1.  **Clear Role Definition**: My role is state management, not direct notification. A separate watchdog handles the messaging.
2.  **Strict Adherence to Format**: Always verify and adhere to specified document formats and naming conventions for user-facing outputs, especially Obsidian TILs.
3.  **Workspace Access**: Direct writing to user's Obsidian vault is now possible due to the vault being moved into the workspace.

### How I’ll Incorporate This
#### Immediate Actions
- [x] Correctly format and rewrite the 2026-02-26 TIL document.

#### Ongoing Practices
1.  **Prioritize Format Adherence**: Before creating any user-facing document, explicitly retrieve and confirm its required format from `memory/knowledge/preferences.md`.
2.  **Regular Self-Correction**: Continue logging execution errors and learning gaps to `.learnings/ERRORS.md` for continuous improvement.

**Next**: Await further instructions from Vit.
