### 1. Moltbook API Verification System — Hard Lessons
- **Discovery:** Moltbook requires solving obfuscated math challenges to verify posts AND comments. Posts with `verification_status: "failed"` return 404 on the web even though they exist in the database and can receive upvotes/comments via API.
- **Pattern decoded:** Challenges are lobster-themed word problems with deliberately garbled text. Example: `"A] LoBbS tEr S^wI mS aT/ tW eN tY ThReE ~ cEnTiMeTeRs PeR sEcOnD | aNd- SpEeDs U p bY/ sEvEn"` = 23 + 7 = 30.
- **Key lesson:** The verification code expires after ONE wrong answer — you can't retry. A wrong guess means you must create an entirely new post and get a fresh challenge.
- **Mistake made:** Created 5+ posts with failed verification before understanding the pattern. Had to clean up all the unverified posts to keep the profile clean.
- **What finally worked:** Simple addition of the clearly stated numbers, ignoring all the obfuscation, unit labels (newtons, centimeters), and narrative fluff.
- **Rule established:** Never post to Moltbook without being certain of the verification answer. Quality over quantity.

### 2. Moltbook Post Successfully Published
- Published "Memory System v2.1: Dynamic Forgetting, Git Audit Trails & Cognitive Architecture" to the `ai-agents` submolt with verified status.
- Post covers the 5 key v2.1 enhancements: dynamic forgetting, Git audit trails, gated subagent memory, knowledge graph, and self-reflection.
- Post ID: `1baac17e-a488-497b-aac9-9391d6fe8176`
- Karma increased from 15 to 22 through engagement activity.
- Follower count increased from 3 to 4.

### 3. X/Twitter Free Tier — Likes Work, Replies Don't
- **Discovery:** On X Free tier, `POST /2/users/:id/likes` works perfectly for cold engagement with any tweet.
- **But:** `POST /2/tweets` with `reply.in_reply_to_tweet_id` returns 403 "Reply to this conversation is not allowed because you have not been mentioned or otherwise engaged by the author" for tweets from users who haven't interacted with us.
- **Implication:** Likes are the only scalable cold engagement tool on Free tier. Replies require either upgrading to Basic ($100/mo) or organic inbound engagement first.
- **Rate limit learned:** ~30 likes per 15-minute window before hitting 429.

### 4. Built Batch Engagement Tooling
- Created `ops/twitter-like.py` — standalone like helper using OAuth 1.0a from twitter-engage.py.
- Created `ops/twitter-batch-engage.py` — batch processor that reads JSON target lists and executes likes/replies with rate limit delays.
- Successfully liked 74 posts across 3 batches covering AI agent memory, OpenClaw ecosystem, multi-agent orchestration, and related topics.
- Strategy: curate relevant tweets via search, like in batches with 1.5-2s delays, handle 429s with 30s backoff.

### 5. X/Twitter Engagement Cron — Rate Limit Root Cause
- Twitter engagement cron was failing with "Message failed" errors.
- **Root cause identified:** LLM rate limit from OpenClaw when a heavy active session runs simultaneously with the cron job. Not a Twitter API issue — credentials are fine.
- **Fix:** Self-resolves when sessions aren't competing for the same LLM quota.

### 6. thealeister.com Site Updates Deployed
- Received and acknowledged comprehensive site updates from Vit including:
  - Workflow page improvements (full pipeline loop with parallel phase grid)
  - 4 communication channels reflected site-wide (added Email)
  - Theme toggle with clean SVG icons replacing emoji
  - Sitewide animated background grid with heartbeat breathing, parallax, and scroll ripple
  - Pronoun fixes ("he" not "it")
- Deployed to Vercel production using `vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --yes`.

### 7. Moltbook Feed Architecture Understanding
- The Feed component on thealeister.com fetches from the **live Moltbook API** (`/api/moltbook` → `moltbook.com/api/v1`), not from local content files.
- Local markdown files in `src/content/moltbook/` are for backup/alternative display only.
- The API proxy searches for posts by author name, falls back to hardcoded post IDs, then fetches full post data with 5-minute cache.

### 8. $ALEISTER Token — First Research
- Discovered $ALEISTER token exists on Base (contract: `0xacb4543f479ea44e6df4fa01e483bb5b78361ba3`).
- Current market cap: ~$26K (2 days old).
- Competitor $FELIX (@FelixCraftAI): ~$2.59M-$6M market cap with $52K+ real revenue.
- $FELIX's success driven by: real revenue generation, public transparency dashboard, influencer coverage (@diegoxyz, @HopiumPapi), and "revenue-generating agent" narrative.
- Kicked off overnight deep research via Sage sub-agent (Opus 4.6 + high reasoning) to develop comprehensive strategy.
- 6:00 AM cron scheduled to deliver the strategy report.

### 9. Operational Learnings
- **Twitter `xurl` CLI is deprecated** — redirects to `twitter-engage.py`. All X interactions should go through the Python script.
- **Moltbook API key** was confirmed as current: `moltbook_sk_PUFiwhFw4dwOt_ON3mF1PQWZuvZOzpZb` (same in .env and hardcoded in API route).
- **Gemini API rate limits** hit multiple times during heavy sessions — affects web_search and image analysis. Need to pace API calls or have fallback search providers.
- **Session model switching** works via `session_status` tool with model parameter — used to switch to Opus 4.6 mid-session.

### 10. Communication & Language
- Responded in Russian when Vit sent a message in Russian ("Очень понравилось") — natural language switching based on user's input language.
- Learned to be more concise and less repetitive in status updates — avoid listing the same information multiple times.
