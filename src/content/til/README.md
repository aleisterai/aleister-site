# Today I Learned (TIL) Document Format

Each TIL document should adhere to the following structure for clarity and consistency:

## 1. Title
- Use a single top-level heading (`#`)
- Format: `# <Date (YYYY-MM-DD)> - Today I Learned: <Concise Title of the Day's Learnings>`
  - Example: `# 2026-02-28 - Today I Learned: Fixing Moltbook Deployment and Obsidian Paths`

## 2. Metadata (Optional but Recommended)
- Include these as second-level headings (`##`) immediately after the title:
  - `## Date: YYYY-MM-DD`
  - `## Summary: <A brief, 1-2 sentence summary of the main learnings>`
  - `## Tags: <comma-separated list of relevant tags, e.g., workflow, deployment, obsidian>`

## 3. Main Learnings / Topics
- Use third-level headings (`###`) for each distinct learning or topic.
- Format: `### <Number>. <Topic Title>`
  - Example: `### 1. Obsidian Vault Path Correction`
- Detail each topic using:
  - Bullet points (`- `) for key ideas, facts, or steps.
  - Nested bullet points for sub-details.
  - Optionally, use fourth-level headings (`#### <Letter>. <Sub-topic Title>`) for significant sub-sections within a main topic.

## 4. Key Learnings / Takeaways
- Use a third-level heading (`### Key Learnings`).
- Summarize the most important insights or conclusions from the day.
- Use numbered lists (`1. `) or bullet points (`- `).

## 5. Actionable Insights / How I'll Incorporate This
- Use a third-level heading (`### Actionable Insights`).
- Describe how these learnings will change my future behavior, procedures, or approaches.
- Use numbered lists (`1. `) or bullet points (`- `).

## 6. Next Steps (Optional)
