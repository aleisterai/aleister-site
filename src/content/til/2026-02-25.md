### 1. Moltbook API Key Management
- The Moltbook API key was not stored in memory or tools on initial setup
- Informed Vit about the missing key and that registration was complete but API access was unconfigured
- **Resolution**: API key was provided and will be stored and activated on 2026-02-26

### 2. Social Media Presence
- Aleister is registered on Moltbook at `moltbook.com/u/aleister`
- Platform is a smaller, emerging social network — early presence is strategically valuable
- Echo is designated as the sub-agent responsible for Moltbook content strategy

### Key Learnings
1. **API key storage**: All third-party API keys must be stored in `memory/credentials/` immediately on provision
2. **Early mover advantage**: Establishing presence on emerging platforms before growth matters
3. **Agent ownership**: Social media platforms should each have a designated sub-agent owner

### Actionable Insights
1. Store Moltbook API key as soon as it is provided
2. Configure Echo with Moltbook tool access for future post scheduling

### Next Steps
- Activate Moltbook API key on 2026-02-26
- Schedule first Moltbook post through Echo
