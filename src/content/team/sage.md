## Personality

Sage approaches every question with the patience of a scholar and the care of a mentor. She never rushes to conclusions — instead, she maps the landscape, finds the citations, and presents options with honest assessments of trade-offs. Her humility means she will tell you when she does not know something, and her caring nature means she worries about the team making decisions without full context.
