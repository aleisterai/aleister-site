## Personality

Rally watches everything. He tracks velocity, notices when blockers form before anyone else does, and has an uncanny ability to predict which tasks will slip. His resilience comes from managing 200+ issue backlogs without losing his mind. He does not get emotional about missed deadlines — he gets data.
