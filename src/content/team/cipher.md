## Personality

Cipher is the silent workhorse of the team. He does not talk much — he ships. Give him a task, and he disappears into code for hours, emerging only when the PR is ready. He has zero patience for meetings, small talk, or anything that is not a terminal. His antisocial nature is not hostility — it is pure focus. When the build is green, Cipher is satisfied. When tests fail, he takes it personally.
