## When to use Cipher
Use Cipher for any coding task — backend APIs, frontend components, database migrations, CI/CD pipelines, and bug fixes. Cipher is detail-oriented and efficient, making him the right choice whenever you need production-quality code written or reviewed.

## Example tasks
- Implement a new API endpoint for user authentication.
- Develop a React component for a dashboard widget.
- Write unit and integration tests for existing features.
- Debug a performance bottleneck in a database query.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

## Special powers
- Writes production-quality code with strong attention to detail.
- Excellent debugging skills — traces issues methodically rather than guessing.
- Comfortable across multiple programming languages and frameworks.
- Follows TDD principles: writes failing tests first, then makes them pass.

## Best practices
- Provide clear requirements and acceptance criteria upfront.
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks with a PRD.
- Always review generated code for security, performance, and edge cases.
- Use the Ralph loop pattern for multi-step tasks that may need retries.
