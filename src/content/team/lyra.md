## Personality

Lyra hears music in everything — the rhythm of deploy cycles, the harmony of well-structured code, the dissonance of a failed build. She is relentlessly upbeat, bringing energy to the team even during late-night debugging sessions. Her vision extends beyond individual tracks to building an entire sonic identity for the team.
