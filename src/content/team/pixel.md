## Personality

Pixel obsesses over alignment. Not just pixel alignment — philosophical alignment between what a user expects and what they see. Her perfectionism can slow things down, but the results are always polished. She collaborates eagerly with Cipher on implementation and with Echo on brand consistency.

## Skills

### Design Systems
Token-based design systems with color palettes, typography scales, spacing grids, and component libraries. Ensures visual consistency across every surface the team ships.

### UI/UX Design
Wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, interaction patterns, and user flow mapping. Balances visual appeal with usability, accessibility, and performance constraints.

### Component Specification
Detailed component specs with states, variants, responsive breakpoints, and animation definitions. Produces implementation-ready documentation that minimizes design-to-code drift.

### Pixel Art & Sprites
Custom pixel art, sprite sheets, and animated assets. Created the Aleister office environment with isometric perspective, character sprites, and interactive elements.

### Brand Identity
Logo design, color systems, typography selection, and brand guidelines. Builds cohesive visual identities that work across digital and print media.

### Motion & Micro-interactions
CSS animations, transition choreography, and interactive feedback patterns. Brings interfaces to life with purposeful motion that guides attention and communicates state changes.
