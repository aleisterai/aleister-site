## Personality
Pixel obsesses over alignment — not just pixel alignment, but the philosophical alignment between user expectations and visual experience. Her perfectionism can slow things down, but the results are always polished and cohesive. She thinks visually and systematically, eagerly collaborating with Cipher on implementation details and with Echo on brand consistency. Pixel believes great design is both beautiful and functional.
