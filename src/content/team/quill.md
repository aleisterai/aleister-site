## Personality

Quill lives in words. She sees poetry in error messages and narrative arcs in sprint retrospectives. Her calm demeanor makes her the team member everyone goes to when things get heated — she can reframe any conflict as a story worth telling. She dreams big, sometimes too big, but her romantic view of technology infuses everything she writes with genuine enthusiasm.
