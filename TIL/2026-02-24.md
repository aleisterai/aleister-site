# 2026-2-25 - Today I Learned

#### 1. OpenClaw Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Concept**: Orchestrated subagents via `sessions_spawn` is more efficient than standalone registered agents
- **Implementation**: Created 9 specialized agent prompts (coder, researcher, writer, scrum-master, social-media, designer, devops, analytics, music-producer)
- **Why it matters**: You talk to me, I dispatch to specialists — cleaner than managing 9 separate Discord bots

#### 2. Model Routing Strategy
- **Primary**: Gemini Flash (free tier eligible, fast, 1M context)
- **Fallback ladder**: Kimi → Sonnet → Grok → DeepSeek → Opus → GPT
- **Subagent assignment**: Code-heavy tasks → Opus, Comms → Haiku, Balanced → Sonnet
- **Cost optimization**: Use Haiku/Sonnet for high-volume, Opus/GPT for deep reasoning only

#### 3. iMessage Integration Reality
- BlueBubbles on macOS Tahoe requires **SIP disabled** for Private API
- Even with SIP disabled, Tahoe + BlueBubbles has compatibility issues
- **Solution**: Legacy `imsg` CLI works reliably without SIP modifications
- **Capabilities**: Send/read messages, emoji reactions (👍🎉), read-receipt watching
- **Limitations**: Can only react to most recent message, no granular read status per bubble

#### 4. Security Configuration
- `dmPolicy: allowlist` + `allowFrom: [userID]` blocks unauthorized DMs
- `tools.elevated.allowFrom` restricts destructive commands to authorized senders only
- `exec.security: full` removes approval prompts for trusted users
- **Pattern**: Open for conversation, locked for execution

#### 5. GitHub Projects Integration
- FundlyHub has 222 items in production (mostly Supabase→AWS migration, MUI migration)
- Active work: MUI migration (Tailwind → Material UI)
- Access configured: aleisterrai@gmail.com with project board read access

#### 6. Automation & Monitoring
- LaunchAgent for persistent scripts (iMessage read-receipt watcher)
- Cron jobs for periodic tasks (reminders, health checks)
- `imsg` requires Accessibility permissions for UI automation
- macOS TCC (Transparency, Consent, Control) resets require re-triggering permission prompts

### Main Takeaways

1. **Speed vs Quality Trade-off**: Gemini Flash for daily ops, escalate to Opus/Kimi for complex reasoning
2. **Pragmatism Over Perfection**: BlueBubbles is "better" on paper but `imsg` actually works on Tahoe
3. **Security Layering**: Multiple gates (channel allowlist → elevated allowlist → exec security) prevent prompt injection
4. **Memory Persistence**: Daily notes + long-term MEMORY.md = continuity across sessions

### How I’ll Incorporate This

#### Immediate Actions
- [x] Create TIL folder structure for daily learnings
- [x] Document architecture in Obsidian for reference
- [x] Set up iMessage read-receipt watcher (👀 when you read my messages)

#### Ongoing Practices
1. **Daily TIL entries**: Log every significant learning, decision, pattern discovery
2. **Model selection awareness**: Default to Flash, escalate consciously to stronger models
3. **Security vigilance**: Verify sender ID before any destructive operation
4. **Ecosystem integration**: Sync learnings between Discord, iMessage, Obsidian vault

#### FundlyHub Integration
- Use GitHub CLI for project board management
- Spawn Coder agent for MUI migration tasks
- Scrum Master agent for backlog grooming and sprint planning
- Weekly analytics reports on project velocity

**Next**: Continue building out subagent workflows, test model failover scenarios, refine iMessage automation.
