# 2026-02-28 - Today I Learned: Operational Hardening & Full System Assessment

## Date: 2026-02-28
## Summary: Major fixes to self-check notifications, Twitter reply tracking, @mention handling, and a comprehensive system assessment that identified and resolved 10 issues across documentation, cron jobs, skills, and memory management.
## Tags: operations, twitter, self-check, assessment, cron, memory, documentation

### 1. Self-Check Notification Fix (Dual-Layer)
- The ASIA self-check was messaging Vit on success with "The ASIA Self-Check diagnostic ran successfully." Simple stdout suppression in `self-check.sh` was not enough.
- **Root cause:** OpenClaw cron system has its own `delivery.mode` setting. The self-check job had `delivery.mode: "announce"` which makes the LLM session report ALL results.
- **Fix:** Changed `delivery.mode` to `"none"` in `jobs.json` AND updated the cron prompt to explicitly state "Success = silence."
- **Key learning:** OpenClaw cron delivery is a separate layer from script stdout. Both need to be configured for silent-on-success behavior.

### 2. Twitter Reply Tracking & Thread Replies
- `twitter-engage.py` was not tracking replies made via API — the `check` command kept re-flagging already-replied tweets.
- **Fix:** Added "Step 0" to fetch own tweets with `referenced_tweets` to auto-detect API replies and merge into `replied_to` state.
- Aleister was using `xurl` CLI (which has broken OAuth2) instead of `twitter-engage.py` (working OAuth1).
- **Fix:** Updated cron prompt and SKILL.md to use ONLY `twitter-engage.py`. Added `search` and `find-in-thread` commands so xurl is not needed.

### 3. X API Free Tier @Mention Restrictions
- Free tier blocks @mentions of non-thread participants in new posts.
- **Fix:** `reply_to_tweet()` now auto-detects the 403 @mention error, strips non-participant mentions, and retries.
- Also strips leading @mentions from reply text since the API auto-prepends them for `in_reply_to_tweet_id` replies, preventing duplicates like "@FelixCraftAI @Adam_Cipher @FelixCraftAI".

### 4. Full System Assessment Findings (10 Issues)
Conducted a comprehensive review of all Obsidian docs and workspace configs:
- **Critical fixes:** Removed `mce-consolidate.js` ghost reference (actual script is `kce-consolidate.sh`), removed duplicate system crontab entries, disabled redundant `x-api` skill.
- **Important fixes:** Updated HEARTBEAT.md from 2 to 9 cron jobs, pruned 5 stale MEMORY.md items (DeepMind AlphaCode 2 proposals), fixed TIL naming convention (YYYY-M-D to YYYY-MM-DD).
- **Discovery:** Cost ledger already existed, no action needed.

### Key Learnings
1. OpenClaw cron jobs have TWO control points: the prompt instructions AND the `delivery.mode` setting. Both must align.
2. When skills overlap (x-api vs twitter-engage.py), Aleister gets confused and uses the wrong one. Disable redundant skills.
3. X API replies via `in_reply_to_tweet_id` auto-prepend participant @mentions. Do not include them in the reply text.
4. Documentation drift is real. HEARTBEAT.md listed 2 jobs when 9 existed.

### Actionable Insights
1. After adding any new OpenClaw cron, immediately update HEARTBEAT.md.
2. When a skill is replaced by a better approach, disable it (move to `.x-api-disabled`) rather than just adding instructions to ignore it.
3. Run a documentation consistency audit at least monthly.
