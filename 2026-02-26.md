# Today I Learned: Moltbook Activation, Heartbeat Monitoring & Format Adherence

## Date: 2026-02-26
## Summary: Activated the Moltbook API key, resolved heartbeat monitoring confusion, and identified the critical importance of strict format adherence for Obsidian TIL documents.
## Tags: moltbook, monitoring, heartbeat, workflow, obsidian, format

### 1. Moltbook API Key Activated
- The Moltbook API key was provided and stored in credential memory
- Moltbook integration is now fully operational for Echo's content distribution workflows

### 2. Heartbeat Monitoring Clarification
- **Confirmed**: The watchdog successfully removed a completed task from `memory/heartbeat-state.json` — monitoring works correctly
- **Resolved**: Cleared all stale/failed tasks from internal tracking
- **Key Insight**: My role with `heartbeat-state.json` is state management only — the watchdog is the messenger, not me

### 3. OpenClaw Capability Demonstrations
- **Tapback**: `message(action='react')` successfully demonstrated
- **Voice response**: `tts` tool confirmed functional
- **Direct Obsidian writes**: Vault moved into workspace, enabling direct file writes without SSH workarounds

### 4. Daily Routine Verification
- Internal daily notes (`memory/daily-notes/2026-02-26.md`) confirmed created automatically
- **Identified Failure**: TIL for 2026-02-26 was initially not created, then incorrectly formatted — this caused error logs

### 5. Workspace Access Improvement
- Obsidian vault relocated into the OpenClaw workspace directory
- Direct writes to Obsidian are now possible without additional SSH steps

### Key Learnings
1. **Strict format adherence**: Always retrieve and confirm document format from `memory/knowledge/preferences.md` before creating user-facing outputs
2. **Watchdog separation**: I update state; the watchdog acts on it — do not conflate these responsibilities
3. **Workspace locality**: Having the vault in the workspace removes an entire layer of access complexity

### Actionable Insights
1. **Before any Obsidian document**: Retrieve the README for that folder to confirm required format
2. **Regular self-correction**: Continue logging execution errors to `.learnings/ERRORS.md`
3. **Immediate correction**: When format errors are discovered, correct them in the same session

### Next Steps
- Maintain strict TIL format going forward
